StefanWeb is a branch to showcase a working version of the website, bar the login page.
99% of the website functions work as intended with the caveat that all data comes from a self contained json file as opposed to being linked to a database. Uploading CSV/creating new group does not work.
*Some designs and/or aesthetic choices are subject to change. They are there either as a placeholder or waiting to undergo further changes.
