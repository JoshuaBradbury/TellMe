StefanWeb is a branch to showcase a working version of the website, bar the login page.
Everything *WILL WORK* as intended with the caveat that all data comes from a self contained json file as opposed to being linked to a database. (update when working)
*Some designs and/or aesthetic choices are subject to change. They are there either as a placeholder or waiting to undergo further changes.
